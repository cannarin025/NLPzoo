# NLPzoo
A collection of the most popular Natural Language Processing algorithms, frameworks and applications (inspired by tensorlayer/RLzoo).

## TODO

The plan for the coming weeks is as follows. 
* Demonstration and implementation of simple text classifier using a variety of common techniques e.g. Bag of Words, Naive Bayes, etc.
* Demonstration and implementation of baseline LSTM model to compare with BERT
* Demonstration and implementation of the BERT language model
* Other models (order to be decided later): UNILM, MASS, BART
